# CryptoChecker-Exchange
In this application, you can check on a number of cryptocurrencies, as well as their exchange rate to various different international currencies. 

This is a Crypto watchlist. The user will type the crypto name/abbreviation and it will pull
the value of the crypto (in USD), this is one API. We will then use a second API to
convert the value from USD to X number of other currencies (CAD, EUR, JPY, GBP, etc).
The user can then add the crypto to a watchlist (which we will store in localStorage).
When the user loads the page, we will pull their watchlist from localStorage, then loop
through and get the most recent value for each pinned currency. This will be limited to 3-5 currencies.or
